        "description": "LOOKING FOR FEMALE ROOMATE – MAY 1st 2020\n\n\nI am a student at Algonquin College and I am looking for a female roommate to share my two bedroom, apartment with come May. I live in an apartment complex located at Baseline and Navaho (15 minute walk from Algonquin and maybe a 2 minute bus ride) and would need someone to be able to begin paying the other half of the rent as of May 1st of this year. The apartment is on the second floor, and there are stairs and an elevator in the building, close to both entrances. The rent fee is roughly $675 per month, and this includes utilities. Laundry and internet are not included in the rental fee, however there is a laundry unit on site and the internet would be about $65 per month total (will be split between us) The shared spaces are furnished, and I will have dishes for the kitchen but you will be responsible for furnishing your bedroom. The apartment does offer tenant parking for $50 per month (I believe that is an accurate price) and it is also pet friendly. I do have a Rottweiler/German Shepherd dog who is a puppy at the moment but will be big, so large dogs would have to be in your comfort zone – she is very friendly and loves anybody who gives her any sort of attention, not aggressive in any way shape or form. I am basically looking to share all expenses (rent, groceries, laundry, internet etc) with another female student or just a responsible person. I will be working most of next year, however the following year I am hoping to return full-time to school in an intense program and need a responsible roommate that won’t cause distraction from my studies and who is also diligent about paying rent/internet/groceries.\n\nIf you are interested please feel free to message me and we can sort out further details and I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. Thanks!!",
