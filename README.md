**Overview:**

Sturents is an application that will scape listings for student rentals from the internet. It then stores these listings in a database that will be queried by the application. The application will give users the ability to go through the listings in a style similar to the application ​‘tinder’ ​ . If a user is interested in one of the listings they can ​‘swipe right’ ​ on it, which will then add it to their list of ​‘liked’ ​ listings. Through this list, the user will then be able to directly send an email to the original poster, or if an email could not be scraped from the original listing, then the user will have the ability to go to the web page of the original listing.
