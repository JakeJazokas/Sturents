Coming to work at an embassy ? Coming to follow a summer program at OttawaU ? Coming to work in Ottawa ? I have 9 available rooms in 3 different apartments for rent (3 rooms per apartment) in the heart of New Edinburgh. The rooms are all available as of May 1rst and are available until August 31rst (4 months). Looking for a shorter/longer term ? It may still be possible to accommodate you. The apartments are all newly renovated and they are also furnished (rooms and common areas). The rent is 950$ per room per month (over the summer months) with all utilities (heating, electricity, water) and wifi included. The only component that is not included in the monthly price is the washer/dryer, located in the building but coin operated. The building itself is located on a quiet street of New Edinburgh but is only a couple minutes away by foot from the the many shops and cafés of Beechwood village as well as the grocery store (Metro). The neighbourhood itself is ranked amongst the best in Ottawa. It is also surrounded by many parks and paths (walking, running, cycling) which makes it very enjoyable during the summer months. OttawaU is approximately 30 minutes by foot or 15 minutes by bus from the building. The Ottawa Hospital General Campus is approximately 25 minutes by bus. The ByWard market is approximately 25 minutes by foot.

Coming to work at an embassy ? Coming to follow a summer program at OttawaU ? Coming to work in Ottawa ? I have 9 available rooms in 3 different apartments for rent (3 rooms per apartment) in the heart of New Edinburgh. The rooms are all available as of May 1rst and are available until August 31rst (4 months). Looking for a shorter/longer term ? It may still be possible to accommodate you. The apartments are all newly renovated and they are also furnished (rooms and common areas). The rent is 950$ per room per month (over the summer months) with all utilities (heating, electricity, water) and wifi included. The only component that is not included in the monthly price is the washer/dryer, located in the building but coin operated. The building itself is located on a quiet street of New Edinburgh but is only a couple minutes away by foot from the the many shops and cafés of Beechwood village as well as the grocery store (Metro). The neighbourhood itself is ranked amongst the best in Ottawa. It is also surrounded by many parks and paths (walking, running, cycling) which makes it very enjoyable during the summer months. OttawaU is approximately 30 minutes by foot or 15 minutes by bus from the building. The Ottawa Hospital General Campus is approximately 25 minutes by bus.
